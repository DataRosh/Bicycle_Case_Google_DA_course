# DATA ANALYTICS PORTFOLIOS

# 1. Cyclistic Bike Share Case Study
   
This is one of the Google Data Analytics course capstone projects. This is focused on analyzing data for a bike share company that is seeking to maximise its revenue by converting casual riders to members. Casual riders are users who purchase single passes while members have annual subscriptions with the company. The analyst is expected to utilise data collected from the company on rider usage to develop marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders to members. 

In carrying out this case study I used SQL for data cleaning and analysis and Excel and Tableau for visualization. I have included supplemental documents for this case. These include a Word document on the data cleaning process, the queries used for cleaning and analysis, and a Presentation which will be presented to the marketing director who has commissioned this analysis.
